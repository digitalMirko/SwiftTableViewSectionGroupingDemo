# SwiftTableViewSectionGroupingDemo
Swift - Swift TableView Section Grouping Demo - Demo 14 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a swift TableView with Section Grouping using Dates for the Grouping titles,
then in the row an image of the item with its name and best season to purchase to the right of the image placement.

To make the app a bit practical it answers the question of when to buy various produce at different times of the year.
From Winter to Spring to Summer to Fall. The sections are broken up by Months from December to November. When the user 
clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted on top with a TableView populated with Sections and rows.

The user can scroll up and down the TableView to see which items are displayed for which periods of time. In this demo
only 4 items are displayed per month. The Cell Row Heights are 60 withe the graphic image being 50x50 to display a 
nice sized image and some white space between the graphics.
